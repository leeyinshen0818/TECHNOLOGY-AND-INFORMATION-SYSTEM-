## Reflection
- PC assembly is an interesting experience for me. I use laptop and pc everyday but never open the case and observe the components inside. Therefore, this activity helped me to know what are actually inside a PC and how these components are connected. From open the case to remove the motherboard, everything needs to be done carefully because some of the components like RAM and wires might be fragile. Whatâ€™s more, even a small mismatching of the components will cause the PC cannot turn on properly. By and large, this PC assembly activity let me know more about the computer hardware components.
