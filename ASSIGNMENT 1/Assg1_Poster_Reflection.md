## Reflection
- This is my first experience attending an industrial talk, which are leaving a strong impression for me since I still have no experience in working in a company. All the information I received are inspiring, especially the part which talked about the requirement to enter a company, including having excellent soft-skills and mastered in programming languages. This provide me a very clear and specific path to fulfil myself with these specifications during my college life. Whatâ€™s more, the PPG representative also talked about the daily tasks of a data engineer which is very meaningful for me. There are four main tasks of a data engineer, first is designing an creating pipeline to make sure the data flows efficiently, second is data programming, which means writing code to manipulate the data, third is data modelling, which is the process of designing the structure and relationships of a database or data storage system, and the last one is data virtualization, which enable other to access and analyze it virtually via special platform. Furthermore, there are some technical terms like pipeline, power BI, data lake, data swamp and many more that I learnt from this talk. All in all, this is a meaningful industrial talk for me and I am appreciate to those PPG representative who were willing to share their experiences to us.
