## Reflection
- Hopefully I can learn and remember all the syllabus and can explain my knowledge to those who are wondering the technology and information system. This design thinking process helps me to learn and research something systematically. Moreover, via this design thinking process, I found that AI is a quite interesting field, it makes the world become convenient. So, I will try to utilize my knowledge to enroll in the AI field in the future. Also, I will try to use this approach for my further study. I will attend more programs and industry talks to fulfil myself with knowledge. On the other hand, I will keep focus on my study and enhance my soft skill.
